<h1>Tropical Cyclone Alfred – Latest Forecast &amp; Path for Victoria Point (QLD 4165)</h1>

<h2>Expected Landfall Location &amp; Timing</h2>
<p>
Based on current meteorological data (as of March 3, 2025), Cyclone Alfred is projected 
to approach the south-east Queensland coast late Thursday. The <strong>Bureau of 
Meteorology (BoM)</strong> indicates a possible <strong>Category 1–2 
landfall</strong> in the greater Brisbane/Sunshine Coast area on Thursday night or 
early Friday (March 6–7, 2025). However, there remains uncertainty in the exact track. 
Residents in Victoria Point should closely monitor official sources for updates.
</p>

<h2>Wind Speeds and Intensity Near Victoria Point</h2>
<p>
Cyclone Alfred may maintain <strong>Category 1 or 2 intensity</strong> at landfall, 
with sustained winds near the core of 90–110 km/h. Even if the cyclone’s center does 
not pass directly over Victoria Point, <strong>damaging wind gusts over 90 km/h</strong>
could affect the region by Wednesday, potentially escalating to <strong>destructive
gusts above 130 km/h</strong> by Thursday. Downed power lines, falling trees, and flying 
debris are possible hazards.
</p>

<h2>Rainfall Projections</h2>
<p>
Heavy rainfall is anticipated throughout south-east Queensland, including Victoria 
Point. Accumulations could <strong>exceed 200–300 mm</strong>, with some localities 
potentially reaching <strong>500 mm</strong> or more. This rain may lead to flash 
flooding in low-lying areas and <strong>major flood warnings</strong> have been issued
for certain catchments.
</p>

<h2>Official Warnings &amp; Alerts</h2>
<p>
The BoM has placed southeast Queensland under a <strong>Tropical Cyclone Watch</strong>.
Residents should prepare for conditions to deteriorate from Wednesday onward. 
Additionally, <strong>Flood Watches</strong> are in effect, and <strong>Redland City 
Council</strong> has urged people in vulnerable areas to <strong>consider evacuating 
early</strong>. Stay updated through official channels and follow any emergency alerts 
or evacuation orders immediately.

    <li><strong>Secure Your Property:</strong> Bring inside loose outdoor items, 
    close shutters or board windows, and park vehicles away from trees.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare for Flooding:</strong> If you live near the coast or along 
    waterways, develop a plan in case of rising water levels or storm surge. </li>

    winds or potential flooding, leave well ahead of the approaching cyclone to a safer

    non-perishable food, medication, first aid, and battery-powered devices to last at
