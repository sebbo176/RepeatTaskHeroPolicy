Tropical Cyclone Alfred – Latest Forecast & Path for Victoria Point

Expected Landfall Location & Timing

Bureau of Meteorology forecast track for Cyclone Alfred (as of March 3, 2025) shows the system turning back towards the coast and approaching the Sunshine Coast as a Category 2 cyclone by late Thursday ￼. Cyclone Alfred is currently moving offshore in the Coral Sea but is expected to reverse course westwards under a high pressure ridge, bringing it towards the south-east Queensland coast later this week ￼. The most likely scenario is a landfall in southeast Queensland on Thursday or early Friday (March 6–7, 2025) ￼.  Meteorologists anticipate the cyclone crossing somewhere near the Sunshine Coast or Moreton Bay region (north of Brisbane), though there is still some uncertainty in the exact location ￼ ￼. Some forecast models show possible landfall locations ranging from around Bundaberg in the north down to northern New South Wales in the south, but confidence is highest for a Category 1–2 landfall in the greater Brisbane/Sunshine Coast area on Thursday night ￼ ￼. This would be the first cyclone to impact the Brisbane region in decades, so authorities are closely monitoring its path.

Wind Speeds and Intensity Near Victoria Point

Tropical Cyclone Alfred is currently around Category 2 intensity, and while some fluctuations are possible, it is forecast to strike the coast as a Category 1 or 2 cyclone (with sustained winds roughly 90–110 km/h near the core) ￼. For the Victoria Point area (bayside Brisbane), this means residents should prepare for very strong winds even if the cyclone’s center doesn’t pass directly overhead. The Bureau’s forecast for the Brisbane bayside indicates damaging wind gusts over 90 km/h are possible by Wednesday, escalating to destructive gusts above 130 km/h by Thursday if Alfred approaches the coast near Brisbane ￼. Wind intensity in Victoria Point will depend on Alfred’s exact track – a landfall just to the north could still bring gale to storm-force winds across Moreton Bay. Even as a Category 1–2 system, Alfred can uproot trees and down power lines over a wide area, so powerful wind gusts and hazardous conditions are likely in the Redland City region (including Victoria Point) during the latter half of the week ￼ ￼.

Rainfall Projections for the Area

Heavy rainfall is expected to be one of the major impacts of Cyclone Alfred. Widespread rain totals of several hundred millimeters are projected for south-east Queensland, including the Brisbane and Moreton Bay areas ￼. Forecast models suggest that some areas in the cyclone’s path could see accumulations exceeding 500 mm over the coming days ￼. Even coastal suburbs like Victoria Point may receive torrential rain leading to flash flooding. The heaviest falls are likely between Wednesday and the weekend as Alfred approaches and crosses the coast ￼. Low-lying parts of Redland City could experience inundation from both intense rainfall runoff and a potential storm surge or higher-than-normal tides in Moreton Bay ￼. Residents should be prepared for flooded roads, water over low-lying coastal areas, and possible creek/river flooding, with the Bureau warning that major flooding is likely in parts of SE QLD and NE NSW due to the expected rains ￼. In short, Victoria Point and surrounding communities should brace for torrential rain and take precautions against flooding over the next few days.

Official Warnings & Alerts

Authorities have issued multiple warnings as Cyclone Alfred approaches. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has a Tropical Cyclone Watch in effect from Sandy Cape (north of Fraser Island) down to Grafton in northern NSW – this watch area includes Moreton Bay and the Brisbane region ￼. Under this cyclone watch, coastal communities are advised that gale-force winds may develop from Wednesday onward as Alfred nears the coast ￼. The BoM and Queensland Government have also issued Flood Watches for south-east Queensland due to the high rainfall projections, with expectations of major flooding in some catchments ￼. Locally, Redland City Council has escalated preparations: a “Watch and Act” alert was issued urging Redlands Coast residents to prepare now and consider evacuation if needed ￼. The alert advises that anyone who feels unsafe in their home – particularly those in vulnerable housing or on the Bay islands – should leave early to shelter with friends or family (since ferry services to the islands will cease as conditions worsen) ￼. Queensland’s emergency services are broadcasting the message “If it’s flooded, forget it,” warning people to never drive through floodwaters, and to follow any evacuation orders immediately if issued ￼. All residents in the region should stay tuned to official updates from BoM (via radio, TV or the BoM website/app) and heed instructions from emergency authorities as the situation evolves ￼ ￼.

Recommendations for Victoria Point Residents

For those in Victoria Point and surrounding Redland City areas, officials stress the importance of early preparation and caution. Key recommendations include:
	•	Secure Your Property: Tie down or bring inside any loose outdoor items (outdoor furniture, trampolines, gas bottles, etc.) that could become airborne in strong winds ￼. Park vehicles undercover (not under trees) and consider covering windows with shutters or plywood if available ￼. Expect power outages – charge devices and have torches and batteries ready.
	•	Plan for Storm Surge and Flooding: If you live near the coast or in a low-lying area, be aware of the risk of storm surge and flooding. Decide now on a safe place to go if inundation threatens – this might mean evacuating to higher ground or a sturdier building with family/friends ￼. Residents on the Bay islands or any location that may get cut off by floodwaters should relocate before conditions deteriorate.
	•	Consider Evacuating Early if Unsafe: Homes not built to withstand high winds (e.g. older homes or mobile homes) may not be safe shelter in a cyclone. Authorities advise that if you feel your home is insecure, leave early and stay with friends, family or at an evacuation centre if directed ￼. Don’t wait until the last minute – moving to safety is far easier before gale conditions commence.
	•	Emergency Kit and Supplies: Prepare an emergency kit with essentials to last at least 3 days ￼. This includes drinking water, non-perishable food, medications, first aid supplies, important documents, batteries, and a battery-powered radio. Have sufficient prescription medicines (minimum one week’s supply) and pet supplies on hand as well ￼. Keep your mobile phone charged and a car fuelled in case you need to leave.
	•	Stay Informed and Follow Instructions: Continuously monitor updates from the BoM and local emergency services. Follow any instructions from officials without delay – if an evacuation order or emergency alert is issued, comply immediately ￼. During and after the cyclone, avoid all unnecessary travel. Never drive through floodwaters or enter storm-surge inundated areas, as these are extremely dangerous ￼. Once the cyclone passes, be cautious of downed power lines, debris, and flooded areas when venturing outside.

By taking these precautions and heeding official warnings, residents of Victoria Point can significantly reduce their risk. Stay safe, remain alert to updates, and be prepared to act if conditions worsen ￼ ￼.
