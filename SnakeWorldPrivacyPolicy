Privacy Policy

Our commitment to your privacy is simple: No personal data shared with us will be given to any third party without your explicit consent, except as outlined below. Your data will never be used by us for any purpose without your specific permission.

Use of Google Ads Services
This app uses Google AdMob to display ads. Google AdMob may collect and use data about you, such as device information, advertising identifiers, and information about how you interact with ads, to provide personalized and non-personalized ads.

Ad Targeting and Data Collection
To provide personalized ads, Google may collect data such as app interactions, device identifiers, and other usage data. If you prefer, you can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device settings or visiting Google’s Ad Settings. You can also review and manage data usage preferences directly within the app (if applicable).

No Data Mining or Sharing Beyond Ad Services
Except for data collected and processed by Google AdMob as described above, we do not engage in data mining, share data with third parties, or use data for other purposes. We do not affiliate ourselves with any third parties that compromise user privacy.

Data Storage
Any data specific to the app’s functionality (e.g., scores, preferences) remains stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to us or third parties.
